                    Exchange study has been restricted in a lot of countries, due to the devastating COVID pandemic. Even though the government started lifting the restrictions this spring, Halden county remained in an area with a high infection rate. From 29. January 2021 entry restrictions made it almost impossible for exchange students to gain entry to Norway. So, the school remained closed and had no physical lectures.

                    From 1. August 2021 all students and exchange student are exempted from the travel restrictions. And thanks to step 3 in the governments reopening plan, the school can have physical lectures on campus again.  Now that most of the restrictions has been lifted and the low infection rate, we welcome a new batch of exchange students with open arms. We have gotten in contact with an exchange student to catch up with his thoughts and feelings.

                <p>
                    Jonathan, a 22 year old engineering student from Paris, had a dream of studying abroad since early age. When COVID erupted, this dream seemed hard to achieve. However, as HIOF and Norway has lessened their restrictions, this dream was eventually made possible. Despite the devastating COVID pandemic, Jonathan like many other were finally able to begin their studies abroad this fall.

                <h2>Studied abroad before </h2>
                <p>
                    This is not his first time studying abroad, as he did his second year in university in Lodz, Poland. Despite what he had heard about Poland, he loved it and felt the year was enrichening in many ways. He learned a lot and met other students from all over the world. This experience made him want to study abroad more in the future.

                <h2>COVID impact on study</h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan originally wanted to continue his studies in Canada, but their restrictions made this impossible, so he started to look for other options. While browsing the different opportunities he found Norway and instantly applied. He has always found Scandinavian countries interesting, and thought Norway is pretty similar to Canada.

                <p>
                    Jonathan, like other foreign students has enjoyed exciting first weeks of his semester. He also discovered early that he was impressed by the quality of HIOF`s IT program; “The level of education seems higher here than in France. The structure of the course work is also more tailored to real world application. The professors in particular, are exceptional here”. Because HIOF has offered attractive courses to foreign students, many like Jonathan reached the conclusion that Halden would be the best place to spend their semester abroad.

                    For now, the exchange students can enjoy a normal student life with the delay in step 4 of the governments reopening plan. However, with the recent rise in infections across Norway, it is uncertain how long this new normal will last. At the same time, many foreign students like Jonathan remain optimistic through these uncertain times.
